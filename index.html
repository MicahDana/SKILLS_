    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>Over the years, I have developed various skills that have helped me in both academic and non-academic aspects of life. In terms of academics, I am proficient in using design and productivity software such as <span class="highlight">Canva</span>, <span class="highlight">Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel</span>. Canva allows me to create visually appealing graphics for presentations, social media, and other design needs. Microsoft Word has been essential for writing reports, creating documents, and formatting text effectively. PowerPoint helps me design engaging slideshows that make presentations more dynamic and interactive. Excel has been a useful tool for managing data, creating charts, and performing basic calculations efficiently. Additionally, I have a foundational knowledge of coding in <span class="highlight">Python, Java, and C#</span>, which allows me to solve problems, develop simple applications, and understand the basics of programming logic. These technical skills have helped me complete projects, analyze information, and improve my productivity in academic and work-related tasks.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I have also developed skills in various physical activities. I have learned how to swim, which not only serves as an excellent form of exercise but also as an essential life skill. Free diving is another skill I have developed, allowing me to explore the underwater world with minimal equipment. This has helped me build endurance, breath control, and an appreciation for marine life. Additionally, I know how to drive, which gives me independence and the ability to travel conveniently. Driving has taught me patience, awareness, and responsibility on the road. Having both technical and practical skills makes me a well-rounded individual, capable of handling various challenges in different areas of life.</p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in activities that help me relax and unwind. One of my favorite hobbies is <span class="highlight">watching movies and series</span>, as it allows me to explore different genres, stories, and perspectives. Whether itâ€™s a thought-provoking drama, a thrilling action film, or a lighthearted comedy, I find joy in immersing myself in different narratives. Another hobby of mine is <span class="highlight">cleaning the house</span> while thinking about other things. Cleaning helps me stay organized, while deep thinking allows me to reflect on my goals, ideas, and life in general. It is a therapeutic activity that keeps my mind and space clutter-free.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy <span class="highlight">walking around the neighborhood</span>, as it gives me a chance to get fresh air, observe my surroundings, and clear my mind. Exploring different streets, parks, and cafes in my area brings a sense of calm and curiosity. Cooking is another hobby I have recently taken an interest in. Trying to cook different meals allows me to experiment with flavors, learn new techniques, and appreciate the art of preparing food. Spending time with my dogs is also one of my favorite activities. Playing, walking, and bonding with them brings me happiness and a sense of companionship. Lastly, I value my moments of rest, as sleeping and simply relaxing help me recharge and maintain my overall well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I have always been a person who loves to explore new things and gain new experiences. One of my biggest interests is <span class="highlight">photography and videography</span>. I discovered this passion because my family loves to travel. Every trip is an opportunity for me to capture beautiful landscapes, candid moments, and memorable experiences. Documenting our journeys and watching them again later is a fulfilling way to relive those special memories. Through photography and videography, I have also learned about composition, lighting, and editing, which have enhanced my creative skills.</p>
    <p>Aside from visual arts, I have a deep interest in outdoor activities such as <span class="highlight">swimming, hiking, and snowboarding</span>. Being in nature, whether in the water, the mountains, or the snow, gives me a sense of adventure and excitement. Exploring new places, challenging myself physically, and enjoying breathtaking views are experiences I truly cherish. Additionally, I am fascinated by different cultures, particularly those of <span class="highlight">Korea and Japan</span>. Their traditions, language, food, and entertainment industries intrigue me. I love learning about their history, customs, and way of life. Watching Korean dramas, anime, and documentaries about Japan has deepened my appreciation for these cultures. My diverse interests keep me motivated to keep learning, exploring, and trying new things in life.</p>
